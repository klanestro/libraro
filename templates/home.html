<h1>About the website</h1>

This website is free software, released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html">GNU GPLv3.</a></p>
<!--<p>Most texts are taken from <a href="/read/don_harlow/">Don Harlow</a>'s extensive <a href="http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/Literaturo/literaturo.html" target="blank">collection</a>. Please <a href="/contribute/">contribute!</a></p>-->
<h1>License issues</h1>

This website publishes works for which the international minimum of 50 years after the author&#8217;s death is satisfied. It is the reader's responsibility to know her country&#8217;s <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing">copyright laws</a>.</p>
