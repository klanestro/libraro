The database and text files are ignored by git. If you want to 
push an updated version, run 

  python manage.py libraro_pack

to overwrite the "packed.tar" archive. After pulling an updated 
archive (or after cloning), run

  python manage.py libraro_unpack

There are a few more custom commands, check them out with

  python manage.py help
